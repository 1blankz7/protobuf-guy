Installation
============

## protoc

### Unix

Use description in readme file. If you get an error after trying to run `protoc`, that calls for a `libprotoc.so` file, you must change into the src directory and run `ldconfig` with superuser rights.

### Windows

Use the description in the readme file also.

## Other languages

For more languages than C++ you can install additional utilities. In the directories `protobuf-2.5.0/python` and `protobuf-2.5.0/java` are the instructions.
